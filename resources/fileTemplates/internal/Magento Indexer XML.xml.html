        Indexing is how Magento transforms data such as products and categories, to improve the performance of
        your storefront. As data changes, the transformed data must be updated or reindexed. Magento has a very
        sophisticated architecture that stores lots of merchant data (including catalog data, prices, users, and stores)
        in many database tables. To optimize storefront performance, Magento accumulates data into special tables
        using indexers.
